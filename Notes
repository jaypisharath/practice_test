I'd like to build a project framework for an app that consists of the following components:
1. A local endpoint responding to curl GET 'localhost:XXXX/hello_world' with a 200
status and {"hello": "world"}
2. A unit testing framework set up with one test that runs and asserts 1==1
3. Add client with the following capabilities:
    a. make http requests
    b. read/write files (csv, json)
    c. process files (csv, json) to extract patterns/labels
    c. utilize the unit testing framework

What are the 3 solutions starting with simplest?
